# Weather-Forecasting-App

Hello hope my app finds you in the best of  your health :)


this is a very Simple App made using NodeJS,Darksky forecasting api and  Google Geolocation api

how to use it:
1) simply pull all of the contents into your system
2) open the directory in terminal and run       npm install

it will install all required modules
3)then run             node app.js  -a 147004

format  -a pincode
 here -a  specifies address and  147004  is pincode or any pincode you can enter

working :  when u enter address   
->geolocation api fetches longitude and latitude
->that longitude and latitude are fed to darksky weather forecasting api
-> and u see your latitude ,longitude on screen
-> and current temperature and wind speed

hope u enjoy this simple app
